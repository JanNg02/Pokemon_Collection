# TODO: Get 3 Latest Sets in Homepage Controller

- [x] Update the set fetch in homepageController.js to use the sets endpoint with params for ordering by release date descending and limiting to 3 results
- [x] Change the variable name from setData to sets to reflect multiple sets
- [x] Update the res.render to pass sets instead of set
- [ ] Test the changes by running the app and checking the console logs for the fetched sets
